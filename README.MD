# Telecommunications-Project-ECE

Semester Project for Introduction to Telecommuntications class in Electrical and Computer Engineering at National and Technical University of Athens during Fall Semester 2021.

The project was a result of team work from me and my partner Michaelangelo Velalopoulos.

There were 5 parts for this particular project

- Part 1: Signal Sampling for a triangle signal with different frequencies
- Part 2: Signal Quantization and calculation of the Variance of the quantization error. We calculated the Signal Noise Error (SNR) of quantization and created the diagram of a bit stream using POLAR RZ coding
- Part 3: Produced BPAM, BPSK, QPSK and 8-PSK bit sequences, created the constellation diagram for BPAM signal, produced Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and added it to BPAM signal, calculated the Bit Error Rate (BER)
- Part 4: Used some text input files to deform them after sampling and adding noise to them and then reformed them
- Part 5: Same as part 4 but for sound input files
